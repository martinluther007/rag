A weight-loss diet plan can often begin in the grocery store.

Planning ahead can help when it comes to purchasing and eating the right foods. If a person can visualize their shelves and refrigerator full of healthy foods, they may also be less tempted to add unhealthy varieties to their stock.
A person can consider the following tips:
Creating a meal plan for the week ahead featuring healthy meals and basing a grocery list only on what those meals need. Then, committing to purchase only what is on the list to avoid choosing unhealthy snacks.
Visualizing the store layout beforehand and avoiding the ice cream and candy aisles to reduce temptation.
Reducing trips to the grocery store by stocking up on healthy items that are easy to store, such as lentils, oatmeal, quinoa, and rice.
Ordering groceries for collection to avoid temptation when walking past the baked goods aisle.
Healthy additions to add to any grocery list include:
canned or dried beans and lentils
grains, such as brown rice and quinoa
fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables
fish and lean meats, including turkey
eggs
yogurt
oatmeal
Understanding exactly what is needed and cutting out snacks high in added sugar and fat can make grocery shopping easier.
